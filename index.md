## Facts about turtles

_Source: [National Geographic Kids](https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/animals/sea-life/turtle-facts/)_

1. Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world – beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!

2. These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago – woah!

3. Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators – some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!

## Famous turtles

- Cecil Turtle from Looney Tunes
- Crush and Squirt from Finding Nemo

- Filbert from Rocko's Modern Life

> Tip! If you have a turtle tank, make sure to change the water frequently!
